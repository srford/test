 sudo bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer )

The rvm function will be automatically configured for every user on the system if you install
 as root. This is accomplished by loading /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh on login. Most Linux distributions
 default to parsing /etc/profile which contains the logic to load all files residing 
in the /etc/profile.d/ directory. Once you have added the users you want to be able to use RVM 
to the rvm group, those users MUST log out and back in to gain rvm group membership because group 
memberships are only evaluated by the operating system at initial login time.
